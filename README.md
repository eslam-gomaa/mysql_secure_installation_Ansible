.

# ✋ Wait a second !

This module has been refactored to get rid of the dependencies issue across distributions, And it's much simpler now.


### Updates

- [x] use `pymysql` lib instead of `MySQLdb 👎`
- [x] Enable authentication with unix_socket
  * Logic:
    * If socket is found, try to login with socket
       * If not able to login with socket, login with user/password
- [x] Add an option to disable unix_socket
- [x] make the output more understandable
- [x] run different commands based on different MySQL versions (Due to changes in newer MySQL versions)


### To do,

- [ ] Update the module doc
- [ ] Test with more distributions
- [ ] Thinking to test with the desired password first 🤔 ( `Changing password` will be updated if the script used `unix_socket` to login)
- [ ] Validate that `disable_unix_socket` works well in MySQl version >= 1.4

## Features

An **Idempotent** Ansible Module that provides the functions of `mysql_secure_installation`

- Change MySQL Root Password - for a list of hosts i.e `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, .etc.
- Remove Anonymous User
- Disallow Root Login Remotely
- Remove Test Database
- disable unix_socket

💎 The Module is **Idempotent** Means that when you run it again, will not re-execute the commands *If the desired state meets the current state*

## Dependencies

This is NOT something to worry about, It is something to make sure it's meet if you faced an error

1. **mysqladmin** command (already installed with MySQL/Mariadb)  -- Needed to get information such as `unix_socket` location & MySQL version
2. **python-pymysql** which can be easily installed using the pkg manager e.g: apt, yum
   * The only caveat is that this package name may differ between distributions e.g: `python3-pymysql` or `python36-pymysql` (Trying to cover all the possible differences in the example provided)


## Usage


💎 A full sample is provided at [sample-playbook.yml](https://github.com/eslam-gomaa/mysql_secure_installation_Ansible/blob/master/sample-playbook.yml) which installs MySQL on `Centos 7` or `Debian buster` 

```bash
# Modify the hosts
ansible-playbook sample-playbook.yml
```



---

* **To use a custom Ansible Module:**
  *  create a directory called `library` in your `playbook` or your `role`'s  directory

```bash
cd my_playbook_folder
# OR
# cd my_role_folder
mkdir library
cp mysql_secure_installation.py library/
```



---



* **Example** - with a fresh MySQL Installation

```yaml
- name: test mysql_secure_installation
  mysql_secure_installation:
    login_password: ''
    new_password: password22
    user: root
    login_host: localhost
    hosts: ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']
    change_root_password: true
    remove_anonymous_user: true
    disallow_root_login_remotely: true
    remove_test_db: true
  register: mysql_secure
  
# To see detailed output
- debug:
    var: mysql_secure
```



* **Example** - Change an existing `root` password

```yaml
- name: test mysql_secure_installation
  mysql_secure_installation:
    login_password: password22
    new_password: password23
    user: root
    login_host: localhost
    hosts: ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '::1']
```

## Test

After refactoring, It's needed to re-test with all the common distributions, Some distros are not tested yet, but they'll be soon.

💎 I'll be more than happen when you let me know if you faced an error !

## Debug Output


* **Note:**  The Module throws a `Warning` instead of an `Error` if the both the `login_password` &  `new_password` are incorrect
